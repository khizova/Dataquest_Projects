    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular site in technology and startup circles, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. In this project we will focus on analyzing posts whose titles begin with either __Ask HN__ or __Show HN__.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit __Ask HN__ posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, for example: _Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?_ Likewise, users submit __Show HN__ posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. For example: _Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'_.\n",
